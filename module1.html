                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>What surprised me?</strong><br>
                    Paul F. Campos's opinion piece was surprising because he highlights the limitations of observational studies and the potential for confounding factors, but he doesn't get into the specifics of why some higher weight categories might correlate with lower mortality. This made me realize his focus was purely on discrediting the existing narrative, rather than proposing alternative biological explanations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Was there new information?</strong><br>
                    Lindo Bacon, PhD, explains the phrase 'Low Decision Latitude' (LDL). LDL refers to the inability of people in lower economic positions to have significant control over how their lives are structured. This concept helps explain how systemic disadvantages, beyond individual choice, can profoundly impact health behaviors and outcomes, particularly concerning food access and stress, which can indirectly affect weight and health markers.<sup>[1]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Did you gain a different perspective on the topic of health research and weight?</strong><br>
                    Yes, I gained a significantly different perspective, and also more questions. Previously, I might have focused more on individual responsibility for health and weight, but Bacon's emphasis on 'zip code' and its impact on food access, community resources, and overall health revealed how profoundly structural inequalities shape a person's relationship with food and body. This led me to question the prevailing narratives even more deeply.<sup>[2]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>What have you learned about myths around eating & weight?</strong><br>
                    I've learned that society is structured in a way that a person's exposure largely determines their self-perception and view of their surroundings. From all the information given (and additional research I've done), I gather that the 'culture' here in the United States has normalized the 'othering' of a group it passionately doesn't want to understand. The compound interest of stress produces a society adrift and unlikely to have a positive self-image. Ultimately, these insights challenge the myth that weight is purely a matter of individual discipline or caloric intake, showing instead how societal structures and stigma play a massive role.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Below is my activities for this week. I enjoy being outside either walking, surfing, paddle boarding, having a long dinner/lunch with my family members and friends.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">**June 6-7:** We're moving my mother from her home in Pleasant Hill, CA, to an Independent Living community in Concord, CA. My usual routine involves walking from my home to the 8 bus, heading to downtown San Francisco, and then often walking to the Ferry Building to buy coffee and a small pastry. During these two days, my mother and I were also cleaning out her closets and going through the garage, deciding what to keep, donate, or sell. I even enjoyed "shopping" my mother's closets! We usually ended up at Jack's in downtown Pleasant Hill, CA, for a nice lunch and wine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">This past Saturday, Standard Deviant opened their new location at <a href="https://www.standarddeviantbrewing.com/pier70" class="text-purple-600 hover:underline">Pier 70</a>, and my partner and I couldn't have been more excited! We walked from the CalTrain station to Pier 70, had a few drinks with a light lunch, and walked for about 45 minutes to see what was new in the neighborhood.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">**June 8:** This Sunday, my mother and I went to the Independent Living community in Concord, CA, to speak to management, get clarity on the fees, and secure a better date for getting the keys. Afterward, my mother and I took a nice walk to the nearby farmers market, where we purchased some chocolate, wine, and sourdough bread. For lunch, we went to Back Forty BBQ and enjoyed a meal neither of us could finish before heading back to San Francisco.
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">**June 9th:** I usually work from home, so when I have time I walk about a mile to my local coffee shop and to the neighborhood grocery store and get some meat, greens, toiletries. 
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">**June 10th:** Because there was priorities with my work I could not volunteer at my community garden. After work, I walked to the post office to mail off an item and to pick-up wine for dinner. 
                    <p class="text-gray 700 mb-4">**June 11th:** Today I have a doctors appointment at 11am. So I woke up a bit earlier to paddle board near the Oracle Park. I also have a lot on my mind from work. Going for a walk/hike or being in the water allows me to think clearly.
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">**June 12th:** Worked from 8-7pm, so I did some surf yoga in my home so I can move my body
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">**June 13th:** Headed to Pleasant Hill, CA to see my mother and to go through the garage, all rooms so that she can be ready for her move to a Independant Senior Community.
