        <p>Taking care of your body and mind is essential in these times. With the constant flow of information (that may or may not be accurate), most people are due for a reprieve from the environment.</p>
        <h2>1. Turn Off Your Devices</h2>
        <p>Social media has proven that as of late, most people are overwhelmed by the content that is put in front of them on a daily basis. To ease the mental blitz, it's advised that for better mental well-being, it's best to turn off your devices. If you can't do that, then try turning off your devices for at least 20 to 30 minutes in the morning.</p>
        <h2>2. Places to Go to Recharge</h2>
        <p>Sometimes it's as simple as staying home, cooking a meal with loved ones, shopping, or doing outdoor activities to relieve the stressors of the day.</p>
