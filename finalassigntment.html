           The image above is of Victoria Kalina, a former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader. She has been openly vocal about her struggles with body image and mental health during and after her tenure. Her journey, including details shared in the Real Pod interview, highlights the intense pressures on athletes and performers regarding body standards and the psychological impact of public scrutiny in demanding fields.

        <h2>"Petite & Proportionate": The Ideal Body in a Culture</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Netflix documentary detailing the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders' process of choosing and eliminating prospective candidates for the squad encapsulates many of the issues addressed in this class. In an episode in Season 1, Kelli Finglass (Director of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders) repeatedly emphasized and visibly conveyed her desire for a "petite & proportionate" look for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader costumes. Kelli and others on the administrative panel made clear that this "ideal aesthetic" should be the foundation of "privilege" to wear that DCC uniform.

            As I was playing this series in the background while doing this final assignment, I was also revisiting my notes from Lindo Bacon, PhD's book. The cultures are different, but the results for the communities within them are the same: a group of people feels the need to offer themselves up to a culture that tells them they are not good enough until they "submit" in totality is crippling to the self-esteem.
        </p>

            In the 2010s, the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders would be weighed often. The uniforms are fitted to the body, so if their weight fluctuates, they would be ridiculed and questioned about their eating habits. Bacon has been vocal about his own struggles about body image. Bacon is thorough about the constant state of 'doubt': Do I look okay? Do I sound okay? Will they like me? Do they accept me in this room? Oddly, Ava from Season 2 Episode 1 said the same thing – not knowing what to do when trying to navigate a system that does not value you, but only the image of you.

        <h2>Social Media, Compensation & Power of Group Think </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Since I don't use social media apps. I have to reach out to friends and family to get the specific details of trends of the "culture". The trends of the "ideal" woman should be thin, with a thigh gap. A young man should have a chiseled jaw line, less than 10% body fat, and find a way to afford grass fed meats. The pressure to be more without having to tools and emotional intelligence to sustain that lifestyle seems to be overwhelming to many who choose that route to fit in. 
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            For the young women who decide to try out for the DCC, they are put through a grueling schedule of training, choreography, makeovers, one on one sessions with directors, being scheduled for trips to churches and media training. They also hold down 2 or three jobs to make ends meet because they are only paid $15 a game ( this has now been changed to $75 a game). Although they have negotiated a pay increase they  do not have health insurance and they are still an independent contractor in the eyes of the Dallas Cowboys.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The trends like #ThinTok, explicitly promote extreme thinness and restrictive eating, sometimes masquerading as "wellness" or "healthy lifestyle" advice. These trends can create dangerous echo chambers where disordered behaviors are normalized or even glorified. While some platforms attempt to moderate such content, the sheer volume and the rapid evolution of hashtags make complete control challenging. This environment can be particularly harmful to young people, whose identities and self-perceptions are still developing and who are highly susceptible to peer and media influences.(<a href="https://www.parents.com/what-is-skinnytok-trend-11716497" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Read more about the #SkinnyTok trend on Parents.com</a>)

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The pressure is not limited to "influencers"; even seemingly positive trends, like those promoting extreme fitness or "clean eating," can inadvertently lead to **Orthorexia**, an obsessive preoccupation with healthy eating that becomes detrimental. The constant need for validation through likes and comments further fuels a cycle of comparison and anxiety about appearance.<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/04/wellness-qanon-coronavirus/?emci=9c20e9fa-6a99-ea11-86e9-00155d03b5dd&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid=%7b%7bContactsEmailID%7d%7d"> - Mother Jones Article</a>

        <h2>Finding a Community That Encourages Positive Views of The Self</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>With all of the articles, videos, television shows, and social media clips. It's important to find a community that gives feedback that is based in kindness and continuous self growth. When it comes down to it, most people are just trying to find a place to belong. Even if that place reinforces a negative self image. I truly think that the way forward ( specifically for the younger generation) is that they may need to ease up on the social media/device usage. Constantly being online can encourage thoughts that had never been there and those thoughts could encourage constant self doubt and anxieties</li>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Understanding the profound influence of cultural norms and social media on body image and eating disorders is the first step towards prevention. Strategies must focus on fostering body positivity and neutrality, promoting intuitive eating, and encouraging joyful movement. Building media literacy skills is essential to help individuals critically evaluate the content they consume and resist harmful ideals. Embracing the diversity of human bodies, celebrating health at every size, and valuing well-being over aesthetics are crucial for cultivating a healthier relationship with food and self in a media-saturated world.
